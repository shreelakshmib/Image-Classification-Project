# Image-Classification-Project

Domain : E-Commerce - Retail

Tech Stack : Python, Jupyter NoteBook

Objective : Scrape Images of clothings from E-commerce websites like Amazon and build an Image Classification Model using Deep Learning Techniques

Solution : Scraped images using Selenium and applied Image Augmentation Techniques using OpenCV. Labelled the data into different categories and built a CNN model. Tuned the model with various hyper parameters and selected the best performing model by using callabck methods like ModalCheckpoints and Earlystopping.

Achievements : Achieved an accuracy of 84.55% with a very minimal loss.
